This Public Repository for the Python Programming Internship at CodSoft by Jeet Kumar. The repository contains all the 3 tasks files made during the internship.  

TASK 2: CALCULATOR
- Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. Perform the calculation and display the result.

TASK 3: PASSWORD GENERATOR
- A Password Generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using Python, allowing users to specify the desired length of the password.

- User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.
- Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.
- Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.

TASK 4: ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR GAME
- User Input: Prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
- Computer Selection: Generate a random choice (rock, papaer, or scissors) for the computer.
- Game Logic: Determine the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice. Roch beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
- Display Result: Show the user's choice and the computer's choice. Display the result, whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie.
- Score Tracking (Optional): Keep track of user's and computer's scores for multiple rounds.
- Play Again: Ask the user if they want to play another round.
